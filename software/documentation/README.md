## Introduction

This compact printed circuit board functions as both a single-cell Li-Ion battery charger and a power-out module. It features a USB-C interface that accepts a stable 5 V supply from sources such as PCs, charger bricks, or power banks, and includes an on-board charger IC that supports charging currents of 250 mA, 750 mA, or 1 A. Additionally, two dedicated screw-terminal outputs provide a secure pathway for charging (Battery In) and deliver battery voltage to a load even during charging (Battery Out), making it suitable for portable applications that demand simultaneous charging and power delivery.

## Functional Description

- The USB-C port accepts a 5 V supply from PCs, charger bricks, or power banks.
- The CN3165 IC manages the charging process safely with automatic preconditioning, constant current, and constant voltage phases.
- CHRG and DONE LEDs indicate the charging status clearly.
- Battery Out terminals remain powered even during the charging cycle, enabling uninterrupted device usage.

## Electrical Characteristics & Signal Overview

- Input Voltage: 5 V (USB-C)
- Charging Current Options: 250 mA, 750 mA, 1 A (configurable via resistor)
