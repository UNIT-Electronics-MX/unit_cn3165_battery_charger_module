# UNIT PWM Module

This compact PCB functions as a single-cell Li-Ion battery charger and power‐out module, ideal for USB-powered applications that require both safe battery charging and convenient access to battery voltage. A USB-C port delivers up to 5 V to an on-board charger IC, which manages charging at **user-selectable** currents of **250 mA, 750 mA or 1 A**. The module exposes two sets of screw-terminal outputs:

* **Battery In:** connects to the battery’s terminals for charging.

* **Battery Out:** provides the battery voltage to an external load even while charging.

# Description 

### Power Input (USB-C)

The USB-C receptacle accepts **5 V** from any compliant source (PC port, charger brick, power bank).



### Safety & Protections

**Over-voltage**, **over-current**, and thermal shutdown features are integrated in the charger IC.

A **reverse-current diode** prevents the battery from discharging back into the USB source when it is removed or turned off.
